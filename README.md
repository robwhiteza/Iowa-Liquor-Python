# Iowa-Liquor-Python
Python analysis of Iowa liquor data

Data:
The State of Iowa controls the wholesale distribution of liquor intended for retail sale, their [dataset offers](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) a view of liquor sales across the entire state. This data was then enriched with [county demographic information](https://www.iowadatacenter.org/index.php), [city demographic information](https://www.iowa-demographics.com/cities_by_population) and [college information](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst&stabbr%5B0%5D=IA).

Due to size, datasets can be found on my google drive: 
- [Raw data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UdPyHXVwa6epscCOJJfsA6LcqmL8jRAy?usp=drive_link)
- [Prepared data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A41UZkQM4lvq98LiCfbrvTPobmjLtrjj?usp=drive_link)

The Tableau storyboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/IowaLiquorAnalysis_16925455199810/Story1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

Due to time constraints the demographic and college information has yet to be incorporated into the final analysis, this will be conducted at a later stage.
